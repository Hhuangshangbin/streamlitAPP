        ## Background of the study
        :red[**Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)**] is a clinical syndrome characterized by acute hypoxic 
        respiratory failure caused by inflammation of the lungs.Over the past 55 years, ARDS criteria have focused 
        on the radiologic manifestations of the syndrome and the severity of the oxygenation defect :red[(PaO2/FiO2)], 
        which reflects the original description and conceptual understanding of ARDS. The Berlin definition, on the other 
        hand, requires that patients receive a :red[positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP)] of at least 5 cmH2O or they 
        cannot be considered to have ARDS.:red[The European Society of Intensive Care Medicine (ESICM)] updated the ARDS 
        criteria in July 2023. The new criteria use an arterial oxygenation index of PaO2/FiO2 ‚â§ 300 mmHg or SpO2/FiO2 ‚â§ 
        315 (SpO2 ‚â§ 97%) to identify hypoxemia, and add ultrasound as an imaging method to assess lung status. Patients using 
        high-flow nasal cannula oxygen therapy (HFNO) with HFNC ‚â•30 L/min were included.

        ## Research Significance
        The impact of the new ARDS criteria on the treatment of patients with ARDS is currently unknown; therefore, our goal was to determine the effect of the new ARDS criteria on patients meeting the Berlin ARDS criteria through a multicenter cohort study and performance of the new ARDS criteria. And to study the heterogeneity of patients in the new criteria to provide guidance on the treatment of patients with the new criteria.

        ## Research Status
        With the updating of global diagnostic criteria for ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome), this study delved into the differences between the old and new diagnostic criteria in patient screening and subgroup categorization with the help of the latest version of MIMIC-IV v2.2 database. Subgroups of patients screened based on the new oxygenation index were also categorized. The new definition aims to optimize the diagnosis and treatment of ARDS by introducing improved oxygenation indices, :red[**such as Pa02/Fi02 and Sp02/Fi02, and their associated disease severity classifications.**]

To further assess the robustness and usability of subphenotyping, we trained a predictive model for subphenotyping and used it to predict subphenotypic membership in an external validation cohort.

        The following five key factors were derived from SHAP as influencing the model, with respiration rate (resp_rate) being the most influential feature in model prediction. This suggests that changes in respiration rate have a significant effect on model output, and that higher respiration rates may increase the likelihood of model predictions.
